            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Graduated in 2020 from Swansea University earning a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with a grade of 1st Class Honours. After that I chased my passion of cybersecurity, investing a year to earn my master's degree in Information Security from the prestigious Glasgow University in 2022. During this time, I took various opportunities to develop Dapps and Websites while keeping up-to date with the crypto space which am very excited to be a part of and contribute in!
